This generic 8 bit IO is implemented using PORTD on an ATmega168.

By default, PORTD comes up in high impedance (input mode).  To use
a port for output, you must set the output mask to choose the
pins to use for output.

If an output notification address is set, then an i2c message is sent
whenever input changes state.  The i2c message that gets sent will be to
the device and address set in addr 0x42 and 0x43 and the data will be two
bytes:  the i2c device address of the i2c device itself, followed by the 
current value of PORTD.

I2C Addresses:

READ
0x40: Read output mask

0x41: Read PORTD

0x42: Read input notification device

0x43: read input notification address


WRITE
0x40: Set output mask

0x41: Write output (and pullups, for output devices)

0x42: Set input notification device

0x43: Set input notification address
